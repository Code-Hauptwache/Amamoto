# Amamoto Development Roadmap

Based on the successful architecture validation, this document outlines the next steps for the Amamoto traffic simulation platform.

## Phase 1: WebAssembly Implementation (Immediate Next Steps)

### 1. Setup Emscripten SDK
- Install Emscripten following the instructions in `src/simulation/README.md`
- Configure development environment to support WebAssembly compilation
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated WebAssembly builds

### 2. Compile and Integrate C++ Implementation
- Compile C++ code to WebAssembly using Emscripten
- Replace JavaScript simulation with WebAssembly module
- Implement performance benchmarking to compare JavaScript vs WebAssembly
- Optimize memory transfer between JavaScript and WebAssembly

### 3. Basic Road Network Implementation
- Create data structures for graph-based road representation
- Implement road segments, lanes, and intersections
- Add basic road editor UI for creating road networks
- Implement simple pathfinding for vehicles

## Phase 2: Enhanced Traffic Simulation

### 1. Realistic Vehicle Behavior
- Implement car-following model for realistic acceleration/deceleration
- Add lane-changing behavior with safety checks
- Implement turning at intersections
- Add vehicle types with different characteristics

### 2. Traffic Rules
- Implement traffic signals and control logic
- Add stop signs and yield behavior
- Implement speed limits and rule enforcement
- Create right-of-way rules at intersections

### 3. GPU Acceleration
- Move position updates to WebGL compute shaders
- Implement spatial partitioning for collision detection
- Create optimized rendering pipeline
- Add dynamic level of detail based on zoom level

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

### 1. Optimization Algorithms
- Implement traffic signal optimization
- Add congestion detection and rerouting
- Create traffic flow analysis tools
- Implement adaptive traffic management

### 2. Distributed Computing
- Add WebWorker-based parallelization for large simulations
- Implement work distribution algorithms
- Create mechanisms for merging simulation results
- Add peer-to-peer computation options using WebRTC

### 3. User Interface Improvements
- Create comprehensive analytics dashboard
- Add simulation parameter controls
- Implement save/load functionality for simulation states
- Add time controls (speed up, slow down, pause)

## Immediate Implementation Tasks

To begin Phase 1, these are the concrete next steps:

1. **Set up Emscripten (1-2 days)**
   - Install Emscripten SDK
   - Test compilation with a simple C++ file
   - Configure project build scripts

2. **Compile C++ Simulation (2-3 days)**
   - Fix any compilation issues
   - Test WebAssembly module loading
   - Benchmark against JavaScript implementation

3. **Basic Road Representation (1 week)**
   - Implement road segment class in C++
   - Create intersection handling
   - Develop basic visualization for roads

4. **Vehicle Pathfinding (1 week)**
   - Implement A* or Dijkstra's algorithm
   - Add path following behavior to vehicles
   - Create lane-changing logic

These immediate tasks will form the foundation for all future development and should be prioritized in the next sprint.

# WebAssembly Implementation Test Plan

This document outlines a structured approach to test the WebAssembly implementation of the Amamoto traffic simulation after compilation.

## Test Setup

### Environment Prerequisites
- Modern browser with WebAssembly support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Local development server running
- Network monitor in browser DevTools open to verify module loading
- Performance panel in DevTools ready for profiling

### Test Data
- Simple road network (single road)
- Complex road network (grid with intersections)
- Very large road network (to test performance limits)

## Test Categories

### 1. Module Loading Tests

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Basic Loading | Load the WebAssembly module | Module loads without errors |
| Error Handling | Deliberately use wrong path | Appropriate error displayed in console |
| Memory Initialization | Check initial memory size | Memory size matches expectations |
| Export Validation | Check for required exports | All required functions are available |

### 2. Functional Tests

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Vehicle Creation | Create a vehicle at specific position | Vehicle appears at correct position |
| Vehicle Movement | Update vehicle positions | Vehicles move as expected |
| Road Network Rendering | Draw road network | Roads render correctly |
| Path Finding | Calculate path between points | Path is valid and efficient |
| Collision Detection | Place vehicles close together | Collision handling works properly |
| World Boundaries | Move vehicles to edge of world | Vehicles behave correctly at boundaries |

### 3. Integration Tests

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Road Editor Integration | Create road network and simulate | Network transfers correctly to simulation |
| Traffic Integration | Vehicles follow roads | Vehicles follow road paths properly |
| Control Interface | Test start/stop/reset | Controls affect simulation as expected |
| Save/Load Network | Save and load road network | Network loads correctly after saving |

### 4. Performance Tests

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Vehicle Scalability | Add 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 vehicles | Performance degrades gracefully |
| Memory Consumption | Monitor memory during long runs | No significant memory leaks |
| CPU Usage | Profile during simulation | CPU usage within expected range |
| FPS Measurement | Measure frames per second | FPS stays above 30 for normal use cases |
| WebAssembly vs JavaScript | Compare implementations | WebAssembly outperforms JavaScript |

### 5. Edge Cases and Error Handling

| Test Case | Description | Expected Result |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Invalid Input | Pass invalid parameters to functions | Proper error handling, no crashes |
| Out of Memory | Create extreme number of entities | Graceful failure or warning |
| Complex Network | Test with very complex road network | Handles complexity without errors |
| Rapid Changes | Make rapid changes to simulation | Stability maintained |

## Test Execution

### Manual Testing Procedure
1. Run the setup script to compile the WebAssembly module
2. Start the development server
3. Open the MVP page in the browser
4. Follow the test steps for each test case
5. Document any issues found

### Automated Testing (Future Enhancement)
- Create JavaScript test suite that automates these tests
- Implement performance benchmarking script
- Add CI pipeline to run tests automatically

## Performance Benchmarking

### Metrics to Measure
- Frames per second (FPS)
- Time per simulation step
- Memory usage over time
- CPU utilization
- Entity creation/update time

### Benchmarking Procedure
1. Create baseline with JavaScript implementation
2. Run identical scenarios with WebAssembly implementation
3. Record metrics for both implementations
4. Compare results and identify bottlenecks

## Test Results Template

```
Test Case: [Name]
Implementation: [JavaScript/WebAssembly]
Description: [Brief description]
Steps Taken:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...
Expected Result: [What should happen]
Actual Result: [What actually happened]
Pass/Fail: [Pass/Fail]
Notes: [Any additional observations]
```

## Regression Testing

For each new feature or optimization:
1. Run all tests to establish baseline
2. Implement the feature
3. Run all tests again to verify no regression

## Cross-Browser Testing

Test the implementation on:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

Document any browser-specific issues or performance differences.

## Conclusion

This test plan provides a structured approach to validating the WebAssembly implementation of the Amamoto traffic simulation. By following these tests, we can ensure that the WebAssembly version maintains functional parity with the JavaScript implementation while delivering improved performance.

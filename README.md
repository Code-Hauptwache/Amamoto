# Amamoto

**Status:** Early Development (Agile & Flexible)

## Overview
This project aims to create a **2D, top-down traffic simulation** that runs in a web browser. The initial goal is to allow users to **draw roads**, place vehicles, and experiment with **basic traffic rules** (e.g., lights, roundabouts).

## Key Features (Planned)
- **Interactive Road Editor** (draw roads, set directions/lanes)
- **Simple Vehicle Entities** (uniform speed, optional collision)
- **Traffic Lights & Basic AI** (red/green cycles, roundabouts)
- **Dark/Light Mode** (toggle between themes)

## Development Approach
- We’re keeping it **agile**—features may change or shift in priority as we learn and iterate.
- Long-term potential includes **GPU optimization**, **Docker/Kubernetes deployment**, and **advanced AI** for traffic control.

## Roadmap Summary
1. **Phase 1:** Basic 2D editor + minimal simulation  
2. **Phase 2:** Introduce traffic rules (lights, roundabouts, one-ways)  
3. **Phase 3 (Optional):** Parallelization & GPU acceleration  
4. **Phase 4 (Optional):** Packaging, advanced UI/UX, and containerization

## Figma Mockups / Wireframes
We’ve started conceptual designs in Figma to outline the UI and user flow.

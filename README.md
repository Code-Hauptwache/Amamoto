# Amamoto

**Status:** Early Development (Phase 0 - Technical Validation)

## Project Vision
A sophisticated web-based 2D traffic simulation platform powered by C++ that grows from a solid MVP to an advanced distributed computing system. Users can design road networks, run complex simulations, and eventually participate in a distributed computation network using shared computational resources.

## Core Technologies
- **Simulation Engine**: C++ compiled to WebAssembly for high performance
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA/OpenCL with progressive enhancement
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for modern, type-safe UI
- **Rendering**: WebGL for optimized visualization
- **Distributed Computing**: WebRTC/WebSockets for shared computation

## Key Features
- **Sophisticated Road Network Editor**: Create complex road systems with multi-lane support
- **Realistic Traffic Simulation**: Physics-based vehicle movement with collision detection
- **Advanced Traffic Rules**: Traffic lights, roundabouts, lane changing, and merging
- **GPU-Accelerated Performance**: Leverage GPU computing for large-scale simulations
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Visualize traffic flow, congestion points, and optimization opportunities
- **Resource Sharing**: Optional distributed computing to run massive simulations

## Development Approach
This project follows an incremental development approach with explicit risk management:
- Begin with technical validation spikes to confirm core approaches
- Deliver working software at each milestone
- Focus on clean architecture and modular design
- Implement comprehensive testing at all levels

## Detailed Roadmap

Our comprehensive development plan is outlined in [PROJECT_PLAN.md](docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md), with the following major phases:

1. **Phase 1:** Core MVP - Simulation Engine & Basic UI
2. **Phase 2:** Enhanced Simulation & GPU Acceleration
3. **Phase 3:** Machine Learning & Traffic Intelligence
4. **Phase 4:** Distributed Computing Infrastructure
5. **Phase 5:** Community Platform & Advanced Features

## Technical Validation (Current Focus)
We're currently focused on technical validation spikes to confirm key approaches:
- WebAssembly/JavaScript bridge performance
- GPU computation browser compatibility
- Entity system performance at scale
- Distributed computation verification methods
